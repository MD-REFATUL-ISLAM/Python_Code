# Addition: adds two operands

# Subtraction: subtracts two operands
print(x*y)
# Multiplication: multiplies two operands
print(x/y)
# Division (float): divides the first operand by the second
print(x//y)
# Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second
print(x%y)
# Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second
print(x**y)
# Power (Exponent): Returns first raised to power second
